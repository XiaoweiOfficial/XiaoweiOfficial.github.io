title: "Genre Dynamics and Strategic Entry into Submarkets: Unveiling the Cooperative Dimensions of First Party Complement Provision."
collection: research
type: "Dissertation Chapter"
excerpt: "In my first study, using a hazard model and employing instrumental variable techniques for robustness checks, I find that platform owners are more likely to introduce first-party complements that reveal development knowledge, particularly in technically demanding genres and in those where little such knowledge has been provided by existing complements. Additionally, a platform owner tends to introduce first-party complements to enhance a genre’s uniqueness when originally exclusive complements have been multihomed to other platforms. The underlying logic is that FPCP can increase a genre’s appeal to complementors by demonstrating how to develop complements within that genre (supply side) and by attracting more customers through improving the genre’s uniqueness (demand side). This paper is aimed for submitting to either the *Strategic Management Journal* or *Organization Science*."
