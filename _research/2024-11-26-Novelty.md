title: "Who Takes Risk? Examining the Platform-Value Enhancement Effect of Novel First-Party Complements."
collection: research
type: "Dissertation Chapter"
excerpt: "In my third study, I investigate whether the platform owner or complementors are more likely to engage in risky and novel product development, considering the changes in the category strength. Typically, firms would like to take on such risks when expected demand is high. I argue that in platform-mediated ecosystems, the platform owner considers a different benefit calculation: leveraging novel games to enhance the platform’s overall value to users, and consequently, its profit potential for complementors. Rather than avoiding risks due to lower expected demands such as in scenarios where a category strength declines, the platform owner is more likely to conduct novel product development to revitalize its platform’s ecosystem. With video game data, I use the machine learning technique to construct the novelty measurement based on games' description."
