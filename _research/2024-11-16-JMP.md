# Job Market Paper

My second paper, which serves as my job market paper, uses fixed-effects Poisson models and extensive robustness checks to explore the impact of first-party complement provision (FPCP) on complementorsâ€™ new complement releases. FPCP refers to a platform owner offering its own complements alongside those of complementors, as seen with Sony releasing in-house games for PlayStation. The findings reveal that while FPCP may reduce the number of games a complementor releases in the focal genre, this effect is contingent on factors that reveal the potential benefits of FPCP to complementors. Specifically, when there is a significant preceding decline in genre strength, the negative impact of FPCP can shift to a positive one. Subsample analyses reveal that younger (smaller) publishers are more sensitive to FPCP and to changes in genre strength. These results identify novel conditions under which negative effects of FPCP may turn positive. The paper is prepared for submission to Strategic Management Journal in November.
